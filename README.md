## About the project

This project was created by VJIT AI students and is used solely for the purpose of education. We created this site to make it easier for you to find a variety of health-related services that were created using AI techniques all in one place. The health services we provide are for informational purposes only.

In this project we have implemented ML algorithms to predict Diabetes, Breast Cancer, Coronary Heart Disease and Calories Burnt. This website is created using drag and drop software similar to Wordpress and have used flask.
